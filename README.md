Two Personal Projects I made last summer

One parses through NY Times and selects a random new article from their websites home page. This updates with real-time for the new articles daily, so you will always get a different article on a different day

The second is a helper that can delete files in your personal computer that I made to clean up a bunch of old files, this has alot of fail-safes, so that you don't accidently delete important stuff
