In this project, I utilized popular sorting algorithms, such as MergeSort, in Excel VBA to
efficiently sort and filter climbing data. I created advanced sorting and filtering mechanisms
that go beyond Excelâ€™s built-in tables and filters, enabling more effective data presentation.
Additionally, I implemented cleaning functions and applied various strategies to showcase
my VBA skills.
