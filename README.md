\section*{VBA/Macro Coding Project (Fall 2024)}

I invite you to check out my \textbf{Efficient Sorting and Organization of Climbing Data using VBA Code}.

\noindent
In this project, I utilized popular sorting algorithms, such as MergeSort, in Excel VBA to efficiently sort and filter climbing data. I created advanced sorting and filtering mechanisms that go beyond Excelâ€™s built-in tables and filters, enabling more effective data presentation. Additionally, I implemented cleaning functions and applied various strategies to showcase my VBA skills.

\section*{Coding Project (Spring 2023)}

I wrote a program that parses the New York Times website and selects a random new article from their homepage. This program updates daily, ensuring a new article is chosen each day.

The second project is a helper tool that deletes unnecessary files from your personal computer. It includes multiple fail-safes to prevent accidental deletion of important files.
