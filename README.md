I invite you to check out my: Efficient Sorting and Organization of Climbing Data using VBA Code

Used popular sorting algorithms such as MergeSort in Excel VBA to efficiently sort and filter Climbing Data. I created some advanced sorting and filtering mechanisms that are more in-depth than excel's built in tables and filters to showcase the data more effectively. I also made cleaning functions and used many different strategies to display my VBA capabilities.

Two Personal Projects I made Summer 2023

One parses through NY Times and selects a random new article from their websites home page. This updates with real-time for the new articles daily, so you will always get a different article on a different day

The second is a helper that can delete files in your personal computer that I made to clean up a bunch of old files, this has alot of fail-safes, so that you don't accidently delete important stuff
