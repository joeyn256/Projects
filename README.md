One Personal Project I made this Fall 2024

Efficient Sorting and Organization of Climbing Data using VBA Code

I wanted a challenge to sort my climbing data in the way that I uploaded it to excel so that it can automatically update and be sorted / presented with corresponding graphs

MergeSort along with other sorting algorithms in Excel VBA to efficiently sort and filter. Also made corresponding VBA Macros to clean up the data, and present the sorted data in the form of 4 grtaphs and charts.


Two Personal Projects I made Summer 2023

One parses through NY Times and selects a random new article from their websites home page. This updates with real-time for the new articles daily, so you will always get a different article on a different day

The second is a helper that can delete files in your personal computer that I made to clean up a bunch of old files, this has alot of fail-safes, so that you don't accidently delete important stuff
